# MATERIALS
1. Add the ability to control denisty and composition, automatically calculate/get cross-sections??
2. Add custom materials 

# PARTICLES
1. Interact particles based on the current material (cross-sections)

# GEOMETRY
0. Add distToBoundary methods for the general shapes, taking into account the current direction vector of the particle. Maybe also add a method to return (x, y, z) of the position of the boundary so moving particles to boundaries is easier!
1. be able to define different volumes each filled with a specific material. 

# SIMULATION
1. Actually make one (and track the particle data, probably binary format with a header is best)

# Linalg
1. Check the Vector3 is behaving normally
