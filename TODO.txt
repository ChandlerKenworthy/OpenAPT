# MATERIALS
1. Add the ability to control denisty and composition, automatically calculate/get cross-sections??
2. Add custom materials 

# PARTICLES
1. Interact particles based on the current material (cross-sections)

# GEOMETRY
1. IMplement getInteraction fo rall types of shapes (boundary dependent)

# SIMULATION
1. Actually make one (and track the particle data, probably binary format with a header is best)

# Hashing
1. Hash or use IDs for each particle and volume and store the next boundary and associated hashes to avoid duplicate calculations
